# Hobbies

Outside of my academic and research pursuits, I enjoy engaging in creative hobbies that complement my professional interests. Below, I share two of my passions: drone shooting and guitar playing.

## Drone Shooting

I use the DJI Mini 4 for drone shooting, capturing aerial footage that showcases landscapes, cityscapes, and dynamic scenes. Operating drones combines my technical skills in hardware and software with a creative eye for composition, producing stunning visuals through experimentation with flight patterns and post-processing techniques. Additionally, in May 2019, I used a Nikon D5300 DSLR to capture ground-based aerial perspectives in Manhattan during the afternoon, focusing on iconic landmarks.

Below are examples of my work:

## Guitar Playing

Music is a significant part of my life, and I enjoy playing both acoustic and electric guitars. I use my Martin GPCX1AE 20th Anniversary Acoustic Electric guitar for playing country music, drawing inspiration from artists like Sting. For Persian and Spanish songs, I play my Cordoba C5 CE Acoustic Electric Nylon guitar, inspired by traditional melodies.

Below are images of my guitars:

These hobbies not only provide balance to my academic life but also enhance my problem-solving and creative skills, which I bring to my research in AI-guided scheduling and embedded systems. Explore my [Research Overview](/index) to learn more about my work!
