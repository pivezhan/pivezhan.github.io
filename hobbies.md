# Hobbies

I enjoy drone shooting and guitar playing, which complement my technical and creative skills.

## Aerial Shooting

I use a DJI Mini 4 to capture aerial footage of landscapes and cityscapes, blending technical precision with creative composition. Follow my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/onedayinusa007/).

**Examples**:

## Guitar Playing

As an amateur performer, I play acoustic and electric guitars, performing country, Persian, and Spanish music.

These hobbies enhance my problem-solving and creativity, which I apply to my [research](/index) in AI-guided scheduling.
