# Publications

My research on AI-guided scheduling has led to several publications and submissions, with more planned as part of my dissertation work.

### Dissertation-Related Publications
- Pivezhandi, M., Jain, A., Saifullah, A., Jannesari, A. (2024). "Work-In-Progress: Energy and Thermal-Aware Scheduling based on HMARL for OpenMP DAG Workloads." In *RTSS 2024*.
- Pivezhandi, M., Saifullah, A., Jannesari, A. (Submitted to EMSOFT’25). "Energy and Thermal-Aware Scheduling based on HMARL for Parallel OpenMP DAG Workloads." Achieved 31.7% energy reduction and 34.1% makespan improvement.
- Pivezhandi, M., Modekurthy, V. P., Saifullah, A. (Submitted to RTCSA’25). "A Statistical Learning Approach for Feature-Aware Task-to-Core Allocation in Heterogeneous Platforms." Reduced energy by 10% and temperature by 5°C.
- Pivezhandi, M., Saifullah, A. (Submitted to ECAI’25). "A Distribution-Aware Flow-Matching for Generating Unstructured Data for Few-Shot Reinforcement Learning." Improved frame rates by 30% in few-shot settings.

### Planned Publications (From Proposed Work)
