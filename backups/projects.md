# Projects

My research projects focus on energy- and thermal-aware scheduling for embedded systems, as outlined in my prospectus exam.

## Dissertation Projects
- **HMARL for OpenMP DAG Workloads**  
  Developed a Hierarchical Multi-Agent RL framework for scheduling parallel DAG workloads, achieving 31.7% energy reduction and 34.1% makespan improvement. Published in RTSS’24 WIP and submitted to EMSOFT’25.

- **Feature-Aware Task Allocation**  
  Designed a statistical learning approach using Random Forest and Pearson correlation for task-to-core allocation, reducing energy by 10% and temperature by 5°C. Submitted to RTCSA’25.

- **Distribution-Aware Flow Matching for Few-Shot RL**  
  Implemented flow matching to generate synthetic data for few-shot RL in DVFS, improving frame rates by 30%. Submitted to ECAI’25.

## Proposed Projects
- **Model-Based MARL for DVFS (Real-Time)**  
  Plan to extend MARL with DDPG/PPO and LLM-based environment modeling for real-time task prioritization. Target venue: RTAS 2025.

- **LLM-Driven CFG-Based Code Optimizer**  
  Aim to use LLMs to generate CFGs from OpenMP code, enabling RL-based resource allocation and code variation selection for minimum makespan. Target venue: AAAI-25.

## Other Projects
- **Global EDF Scheduling of Parallel Tasks**  
  Collaborated on real-time scheduling bounds for uniform multicores. Submitted to EMSOFT’25.
- **Precise Scheduling of DAG Tasks**  
  Worked on dynamic power management for DAG tasks. Published in ECRTS’23.
