# Academic Pages is a ready-to-fork GitHub Pages template  
### for academic personal websites

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages.  
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository.

This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: [publications](#), [news](#), [teaching](#), a [portfolio](#), [blog posts](#), and a dynamically-generated [CV](#).

You can fork this template right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

## A data-driven personal website

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website’s content from its form.  
The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme.

You keep these various markdown (`.md`), YAML (`_config.yml`), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository.  
Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub Pages service](https://pages.github.com/) creates static HTML pages based on these files, hosted on GitHub’s servers for free.

---

> You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over – just be sure to save the markdown files!

If you want to display structured data like your news, publications, or CV, use the markdown files.  
Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](#) that animates talks about to display a [map of every location you’ve given a talk](#).
